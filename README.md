This repository contains a binary classifier model that predicts for a venture capital firm whether applicants will become successful. In order to do this, the model uses machine learning and neural networks with the provided data.

The model is done in three steps:
1) Data preparation for the Neural Network Model
2) Compilation and Evaluation of a Binary Classification Model.
3) Optimization of the Model.
